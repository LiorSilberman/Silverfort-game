# Silverfort Game

A real-time multiplayer web game built with React, TypeScript, Node.js, and Socket.IO. Players compete on a shared game board where they must strategically click cells to change shapes and colors while avoiding adjacent conflicts.

## ðŸŽ® Game Rules

### Objective
Score points by clicking cells on a 3Ã—6 grid. Each click changes both the shape and color of the cell to a valid combination.

### Game Mechanics
- **Grid**: 3 rows Ã— 6 columns (18 cells total)
- **Shapes**: Triangle, Square, Diamond, Circle
- **Colors**: Red, Green, Blue, Yellow
- **Valid Move**: No orthogonally adjacent cell (up/down/left/right) can share the same shape or color
- **Scoring**: +1 point per valid move
- **Cooldown**: 3-turn cooldown after clicking a cell
- **Game Over**: When no valid shape+color combination exists for any cell

### Multiplayer Features
- **Real-time synchronization** across all connected clients
- **Shared game state** - all players see the same board and score
- **Leaderboard system** with persistent top 10 scores
- **Session tracking** - players from the same game session are grouped together
